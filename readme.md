<h2>üßê Features</h2>

Here're some of the project's best features:

*   Interactive Controls: Includes user interaction capabilities allowing for rotation zooming and exploration of the 3D model.
*   GLSL Shaders: Implements custom GLSL shaders to enhance visual effects enabling realistic lighting shading and material properties
*   Parallax Effect: Incorporates a parallax effect using GLSL shaders creating an illusion of depth by simulating the displacement of surface details based on the viewer's perspective. This technique enhances realism without adding extra geometry optimizing performance
